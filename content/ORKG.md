ORKG achieves this by structuring the research papers using Knowledge Graphs.
This also makes it easier to peer review a paper.
THE ORKG uses RDF as as Base for Knowledge Graph Development.

## Funding

Main focus of ORKG

The Problem
- The science community has communicated the same way since its upcoming.
- Approximately 2,5 million scientific articles are published yearly
- Because of missing structure, researchers cant find relevant papers. (Research flood)

- Causes a scientific crisis:
    - Results can't be reproduced
    - Lack of peer reviewed papers
    - Even in small science field peers drown in a information flood
    - Ultimalely the loss of knowledge occurs
